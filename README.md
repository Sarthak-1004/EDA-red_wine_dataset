# EDA-red_wine_dataset
**Project Overview**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Red Wine Quality Dataset to understand the chemical properties that influence wine quality. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature exploration, correlation analysis, and visualization to identify patterns and insights that can support predictive modeling.

**Files in Repository**

- eda-redwinedata.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing step-by-step EDA.

- winequality-red.csv → Dataset used for analysis (Red Wine Quality Dataset).

**Key Steps in EDA**

- Handling missing values and dataset inspection.

- Statistical summary and distribution analysis.

- Correlation analysis between wine features and quality.

- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

- Feature scaling for further modeling use.

**Insights**

- Certain chemical features (like alcohol, sulphates, and volatile acidity) show strong relationships with wine quality.

- Visualizations highlight trends in how features impact quality scores.

- Data prepared for potential Machine Learning models.

**Technologies Used**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Scikit-learn (for scaling)

- Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset Source**

The dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
